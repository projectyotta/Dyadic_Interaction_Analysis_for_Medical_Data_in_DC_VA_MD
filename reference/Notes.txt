2. In each of the excel files , deleted the unnecessary roles . Have also mentioned the roles that I am keeping . 
Also have a query regarding a role ( whether to keep it or not ... waiting for Prof. Kaplan to reply so I can proceed ). 
To view a list of all the roles that have been deleted , please refer to reference > Keeping_Deleting_maybe.xlsx 

3. From each role in each file ( 2013 ...2016 ) , copied the doctor names into a single excel file . Removed the empty rows . Deleted the duplicate items . 
Used Excel Macros to do this . Code has been mentioned below : 

# sample code to delete empty rows in each role for each year : 

Sub Macro1()
'
' Macro1 Macro
'

'
    Selection.ClearContents
    Columns("A:A").Select
    Selection.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeBlanks).Select
    Selection.EntireRow.Delete
    Range("C5").Select
End Sub


# sample code to delete duplicate values : 

Sub Macro2()
'
' Macro2 Macro
'

'
    Range(Selection, Selection.End(xlDown)).Select
    ActiveSheet.Range("$A$1:$A$536").RemoveDuplicates Columns:=1, Header:=xlNo
    Range("B513").Select
End Sub

4.  Arranged entries by date by using Filter - Sort oldest to lowest function in excel .

5. Identified potential red flags in the doctor name list and marked them. What to do with those to be decided after talking to Prof Kaplan .
